# Laravel ToDoApp-starter

In this series of git repo, we will attempt to create a To Do App using Laravel framework along with Bootstrap, Jquery, Jquery UI & Ajax.

We will be using Laravel's eloquent ORM (Object relational mapping) capabilities to form a relationship between user & it's projects + tasks + subtasks.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
